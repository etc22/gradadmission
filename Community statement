I did my primary and secondary education in something called a "little school", which is a type of "Danish free school". There
exists about sixty little school in all of Denmark. The purpose of the little school [which often contains no more than 100
children, and is located in the woods] is to promote inclusiveness, interaction with body and nature, and collaboration. As an
example, in the primary education we spend the first hour every day dancing, singing, fighting [just for fun though!]. In later
classes we shifted toward project based outdoor assignments, theater and music. I believe that "[REDACTED]" has
given me a unique view on conflict management and social interaction.
